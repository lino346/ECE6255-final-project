# Voice_Scrambling

In this project, we mainly explore different methods for voice scrambling which is only designed to make the voice not readily intelligible. Specifically, we perform scrambling on both time domain and frequency domain to see the effectiveness of scrambling methods. It should be noted that the level of sophistication in voice scrambling is not very high and thus not very secure; however, for tactical or temporary privacy, it may suffice. In addition, we also implement a simple encryption system using generated key to have a better idea of how voice encryption works.

# It's Time to Run
Please refer to each folder for detailed descriptions: TimeDomain FrequencyDomain deinvert Encription

The audio files we use in our project are under folder './audio'.
Please remember to check the path of audio files if you are running the code.

You can check the original presentation if the audio file is not working.
